title: Getting Started with Beaker
---

Welcome! Beaker is a peer-to-peer browser for Web hackers. It includes a bunch of tools:

* [Instant website creation](beginner/creating-new-hyperdrives.md)
* [A builtin editor](beginner/using-the-editor.md)
* [A terminal environment](advanced/webterm.md)
* [Peer-to-peer Web APIs](/#apis)
* and more.

In this guide, we're going to familiarize you with Beaker's ideas and tools.

## What is this peer-to-peer thing?

Beaker uses a peer-to-peer protocol called Hypercore, or Hyper for short. "Hyperdrives" are like websites. They store webpages, pictures, media, user data, and so on. Hyperdrives power a lot of Beaker's best features.

:::note
**"Hyperdrives" are folders you host from your computer.** They contain web pages which you can browse and edit. You can create and share hyperdrives using Beaker. [Learn more](beginner/creating-new-hyperdrives.md).

Peer-to-peer means that you host data directly from your device.

One fun attribute of peer-to-peer is "co-hosting." This is where you help keep a hyperdrive online by storing the data and contributing bandwidth to other users. It happens temporarily when you visit a hyperdrive, but you can turn it on permanently for sites you like.

**You can "host" other people's hyperdrives** to help keep them online and contribute bandwidth. [Learn more](beginner/hosting-hyperdrives.md).
